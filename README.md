# Introduction

Personal curation guide of interview preparation materials and timeline for the Big 4 Software Engineer/Developer interviews (SWE/SWDE) interviews. I will update this throughout my entire process, so feel free to commit or suggest changes. 

## Pre-requisite courses/knowledge (suggested-not required) (1-1.5 year) 

 ### Thoughts
I recommend having at least a general knowledge of some these subjects to speed up the learning process. Some of these subjects are not required but can helpful in learning.

 ### Math
Pre-Calculus, Calculus I-III (A-C) w/ Analytic Geometry, Probability & Statistics, Engineering Mathematics, Probability & Statistics, Differential Equations, Linear Algebra, Number Theory & Cryptography.

### CS/Engineering
Discrete Mathematics/Structures, Algorithms & Data Structures, Programming in C/C++ I & II, Computer Architecture, Embedded System Design/Programming, Web Programming (HTML ,JS, CSS, SQL, Node.JS, TS)

### Advanced Topics
*Note to Add (Coming Soon)

# Cheat Sheets

# Interview Topics 

## Algorithm Complexity: Big-O notation. 
### Worst and Best Time complexity. 
### Worst Space Complexity
## Sorting: Know how to sort.  Don't do bubble-sort.  You should know the details of at least one n*log(n) sorting algorithm, preferably two (say, quicksort and merge sort).  Merge sort can be highly useful in situations where quicksort is impractical, so take a look at it.  
### Quick Sort
### Merge Sort
### Heap Sort
### Counting & Radix Sort
## Hashtables: 
### You absolutely should know how they work.  
### Be able to implement one using only arrays in your favorite language, in about the space of one interview. 
### Hash Function techniques for a 
#### number type, 
#### char, 
#### string object
## Hash Compression
###### Modulo by array size
## Hash Collisions
###### Chaining
## Trees: 
### Basic tree construction, 
#### traversal and manipulation algorithms.  
#### Constructor
#### Insert
#### Search
#### Delete
### Familiarize yourself with 
#### binary trees
#### n-ary trees
#### trie-trees
### Be familiar with at least one type of balanced binary tree, whether it's a 
#### red/black tree
#### splay tree (recommend)
#### AVL tree
### Understand tree traversal algorithms: 
#### BFS 
#### DFS 
###### differences between inorder, postorder and preorder. 
## Graphs: Graphs are really important at Google.  There are 
### Ways to represent a graph w/ pros & cons.  
#### Edge List
#### Adjacency Matrix
#### Adjacency List
### Graph traversal algorithms: Know their computational complexity, their tradeoffs, and how to implement them in real code. 
#### breadth-first search 
#### depth-first search.  
### If you get a chance, try to study up on fancier algorithms such as 
#### Dijkstra 
#### A* search
#### (suggested) Kruskals Algorithm
## Other Data Structures:  You should study up on as many other data structures and algorithms as possible.  
### Know about the most famous classes of NP-complete problems and be able to recognize them when an interviewer ask you them in disguise
#### traveling salesman 
#### knapsack problem.
### What NP-complete means.
### Know basic discrete math questions
