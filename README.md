## Introduction

Personal curation guide of interview preparation materials and timeline for the Big 4 Software Engineer/Developer interviews (SWE/SWDE) interviews. I will update this throughout my entire process, so feel free to commit or suggest changes. 

## Pre-requisite courses/knowledge (suggested-not required) (1-1.5 years) 

### Thoughts
I recommend having at least a general knowledge of some these subjects to speed up the learning process. Some of these subjects are not required but can helpful in learning.

### Math
Pre-Calculus, Calculus I-III (A-C) w/ Analytic Geometry, Probability & Statistics, Engineering Mathematics, Probability & Statistics, Differential Equations, Linear Algebra, Number Theory & Cryptography.

### CS/Engineering
Discrete Mathematics/Structures, Algorithms & Data Structures, Programming in C/C++ I & II, Computer Architecture, Embedded System Design/Programming, Web Programming (HTML ,JS, CSS, SQL, Node.JS, TS)

### Advanced Topics (Coming Soon)
* Note to Add

# Cheat Sheets 

 * [Cheat Sheet 1](https://gist.github.com/TSiege/cbb0507082bb18ff7e4b)

# Interview Topics 

* This list contains compiled topics from several tech companies.

## Algorithm Complexity: Big-O notation. 
* Worst and Best Time complexity. 
* Worst Space Complexity
## Sorting: 
* Know how to sort.  Don't do bubble-sort.  You should know the details of at least one n*log(n) sorting algorithm, preferably two (say, quicksort and merge sort).  Merge sort can be highly useful in situations where quicksort is impractical, so take a look at it.  
* Quick Sort
* Merge Sort
* Heap Sort
* Counting & Radix Sort
## Hashtables: 
* You absolutely should know how they work.  
* Be able to implement one using only arrays in your favorite language, in about the space of one interview. 
### Hash Function techniques for a 
  * number type, 
  * char, 
  * string object
#### Hash Compression
    * Modulo by array size
## Hash Collisions
 * Chaining
## Trees: 
### Basic tree construction, 
 * traversal and manipulation algorithms.  
 * Constructor
 * Insert
 * Search
 * Delete
### Familiarize yourself with 
 *  binary trees
 *  n-ary trees
 *  trie-trees
### Be familiar with at least one type of balanced binary tree, whether it's a 
 *  red/black tree
 *  splay tree (highly recommended)
 *  AVL tree
### Understand tree traversal algorithms: 
 *  BFS 
 *  DFS 
 *  Differences between inorder, postorder and preorder. 
## Graphs:
 *  Edge List
 *  Adjacency Matrix
 *  Adjacency List
 *  Know difference and how to implment them properly
### Graph Traversal Algorithms: 
 * Know their computational complexity, their tradeoffs, and how to implement them in real code. 
 *  breadth-first search 
 *  depth-first search.  
### If you get a chance, try to study up on fancier algorithms such as 
 *  Dijkstra 
 *  A* search
 * Kruskals Algorithm (highly suggested)
## Other Data Structures & Algorithms:  
* You should study up on as many other data structures and algorithms as possible.  
* Know about the most famous classes of NP-complete problems and be able to recognize them when an interviewer ask you them in disguise
* [Compiled List of Data Structures for Interviews](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-top-data-structures-you-should-know-for-your-next-coding-interview-36af0831f5e3/)
* traveling salesman 
* knapsack problem.
* What NP-complete means.
## Know basic discrete math questions
